    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>You might not want to be a pork cutlet, but with this recipe you can totally eat a pork cutlet!  And, really, what could be more desirable than a steaming bowl of rice, breaded pork cutlet, onions, and egg. Funnily enough, katsu and the word for victory are pronounced the same in Japanese (カツ and 勝つ, respectively), so athletes will often eat some katsudon before or after they compete.
        So, in honor if Yuri Katsuki’s birthday, make some tasty katsudon!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups cooked rice ( following this recipe if you can.  Feel free to make it ahead of time and heat it up before plating, but I’ll let you know when to start cooking the rice if you want to make everything all at once)</li>
        <li>2 boneless pork chops (and a meat mallet)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Flour for dusting</li>
        <li>1 egg beaten, for breading</li>
        <li>1 cup panko</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dashi stock (you can use chicken or vegetable stock if you can’t get a hold of some dashi or dashi powder)</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp. soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. mirin</li>
        <li>2 Tsp. sugar</li>
        <li>1 small onion, sliced thin</li>
