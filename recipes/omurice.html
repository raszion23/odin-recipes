    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Omurice, believe it or not, is a simplistic, classic dish.  
        Someone once wrote that it is the Japanese answer to a grilled cheese sandwich: nostalgic, easy, and perfect for brunches and kids’ breakfasts.  
        So, for someone trying to be as professional with their cooking and impress their crush, 
        it makes sense for Minko to shoot down the omurice idea for her menu. 
        On the other hand, this filling meal is probably a perfect (and delicious) way to let a person know that you like them.  
        Either way, omurice is a wonderful dish to start off your morning or afternoon.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups of cooked white rice</li>
        <li>1 small, boneless chicken breast</li>
        <li>2 mushrooms</li>
        <li>½ onion</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Vegetable or olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop up the mushrooms, onions, garlic, and chicken.  I recommend cooking the chicken in the oven a bit, first, with some seasonings (I just use salt, pepper, and some curry powder), so you won’t have to worry about raw chicken.</li>
        <li>Heat up some oil in the pan (USE A MEDIUM/SMALL PAN.  A little smaller than the size of your plate is good. This is important for the egg) to medium low.  Once the oil is hot, add the vegetables and the chicken with 2 teaspoons of the ketchup and 2 teaspoons of the soy sauce.</li>
        <li>Once the onion becomes clear, add in the rice, and the rest of the ketchup and soy sauce.  Mix everything together.  Once the rice is hot, and thoroughly mixed with the other ingredients, put it all in a bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Once the egg sheet is cooked, place it onto your plate.  Move it so it is only on one half of the plate (it should be falling off the edge.  Just fold it over or roll that part up for the time being).  Place the rice in the middle of the plate, over a bit of the egg sheet.  Then fold the egg sheet over the top of the rice, and tuck it under the other side of the rice.  Put some ketchup on your finished omurice.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Voila!  You’re done!  The fun thing about omurice is drawing decorations or writing things with the ketchup.  Just as a warning, it is a lot harder to do this than you would think.  Some common things written on omurice in Japan (which you might want to consider):</p>
