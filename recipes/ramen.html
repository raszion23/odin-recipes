    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Guess who’s back!  I finally have enough time and energy to make up some more recipes, and what better recipe to celebrate than some ramen?  
       I got a lot of suggestions for this one, and I understand why.  When I was big into Naruto, those hot steaming bowls of ramen seemed like the absolute perfect meal.  
       However, back then, I didn’t understand the difference between those, and what came out of Top Ramen packets.  Now, I’m still using the Top Ramen noodles, but I’ve added a lot more traditional ramen elements.  
       And even if the noodles and stock aren’t 110% authentic, it’s still delicious.  Believe it!!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups cooked rice ( following this recipe if you can.  Feel free to make it ahead of time and heat it up before plating, but I’ll let you know when to start cooking the rice if you want to make everything all at once)</li>
        <li>2 boneless pork chops (and a meat mallet)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Flour for dusting</li>
        <li>1 egg beaten, for breading</li>
        <li>1 cup panko</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dashi stock (you can use chicken or vegetable stock if you can’t get a hold of some dashi or dashi powder)</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp. soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. mirin</li>
        <li>2 Tsp. sugar</li>
        <li>1 small onion, sliced thin</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup peas (alternatively, you can top it with scallions/green onions, thinly sliced nori, sesame seeds, whole snowpeas, and any combination of any of these)</li>
    </ul>
